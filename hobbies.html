            <h2>Working Out</h2>
            <p>I was a gymnast for 15 years and this lead me to a love of working out and being active. My favorite kind of workouts are Pilates, HIIT and Barre, in fact I am currently getting a certificate in pilates! I am also apart of a few workout groups on campus.</p>
