            <h2>Sedona AZ</h2>
            <p> Sedona Arizona is another one of my favorite places. It is absolutely stunning, maybe even the prettiest place I have ever been. While I visited I got to go on several hikes, explore downtown, and watch the sunset over the redrocks. </p>

            <p>In Summer of 2022 I went to Europe for a month to see family that live in Amsterdam and I also got to visit Paris, Madrid and Barcelona. This trip was one of the best experinences I have ever had and taught me alot about different cultures. Some of my favorite things I did on this trip include visiting the eiffel tower, going to many museums and swimming in the Meditaranian.</p>
